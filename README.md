# Library project

This is an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library#assignment) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## Roadmap:
- [x] Create a function to add books 
- [x] Toggle read/unread button to change book status
- [x] Add demo data
- [x] Delete books by clicking trash icon
- [x] Delete books from actual array by clicking on the trash icon
  - [x] Find how to access myLibrary
- [x] Change myLibrary content when toggling read/unread
- [x] Create modal to add books
- [x] Add status notifications  (see [this](https://www.cssscript.com/minimal-notification-popup-pure-javascript/))
- [x] Calculate the percentage of collection read
- [x] Dynamically updated collections

## Maybe later:
- [ ] Have a clear all books button
- [ ] Make responsive
- [ ] Add right click menu to delete, see book on Amazon or Goodreads, change reading status, export book data, etc.
- [ ] Add operation history
- [ ] Add some sound effects (see [this](https://gomakethings.com/how-to-play-a-sound-with-javascript/))
- [ ] Prevent duplicates

## What I realised
- I need to get better at working with arrays of objects.
